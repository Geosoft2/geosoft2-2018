**Enhancing discovery of geospatial datasets in data repositories**

Teachers: [@nuest](https://github.com/nuest/), [@edzer](http://github.com/edzer/)

[Learnweb course](https://xsso.uni-muenster.de/LearnWeb/learnweb2/course/view.php?id=33123)

## Initial training resources

Handouts for presentations on technical background and concepts required for this year's project task in Geosoftware II at ifgi.
These handouts are the core of the preparation of a topic by each student/pair of students.
The handout should be prepared in a manner so that fellow students can use it as a starting point for getting up to speed on new content and making decisions during their project work.

### Process

1. Fork this project
1. Do your research
1. Create a folder for your topic (`topic-title-no-capitals-with-hyphens-not-underscores`)
1. Add a file `handout.md` file in your folder
    * Take a look at the [markdown syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
    * Split up your work into logical sections and use informative names for each of these
    * Add any additional files needed (graphics not already available online, for example) to your folder
    * Add your GitHub username at the beginning of the document, e.g. [@nuest](https://github.com/nuest/)
1. Add a git tag `handout-submission-<name>` and push it to your fork
1. Send a pull request before the submission deadline containing your handout (not the presentation)
    * Give the pull request a useful name and description, and @-mention all contributors in the pull request description
    * Implement the feedback by the lecturers
    * Update the pull request by pushing the changes to your repository
1. Create a presentation based on your handout (optional: add it to your folder)
1. Present at the seminar (approx. 10 minutes + 5 minutes questions and discussion, prepare to fill the 5 minutes with additional content if no questions are asked)
1. Incorporate feedback from the presentation into the handout and update the pull request (don't forget to [sync your fork/merge `upstream master` beforehand](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/))
1. If you see an error in or want to add information to a colleague's handout ...
    1. Make a comment to the open PR if it is still open
    1. At any later point in time: make the changes yourself (fetch and merge into your fork, make the changes, send a pull request to the original author of the topic and present your changes, original author may then merge and send a PR to the main repository)
1. Teacher merges the final handout version after grading

### Evaluation

The evaluation is conducted based on the content of the handout, the presentation itself, and the discussion afterwards during the course.
Be prepared for questions by your fellow students and the teachers, but also prepare some additional content or questions yourself so that you can stick to (= fill up completely) your presentation time slot.

### Topics

Make sure you cover at least the mentioned keywords.
More is better, but only really better if you evaluate alternatives, phrase opinions, and provide guidelines for your fellow students.

- scholarly publishing: history and future
- academic search engines
- data publishing requirements in science
- research data lifecycle & best practices
- geospatial data formats & libraries
- time series data formats & libraries
- FOSS repositories & preservation
- publication metadata
- Geodata catalogues & geospatial metadata
- metadata extraction
- spatial similarity calculation
- agile software development
