# Code Guidelines for Geosoft II

If you have any questions contact [@nuest](https://github.com/nuest).

## Documentation

* Speaking method names and understandable class names are the minumum documnetation, and can actually suffice for documentation.
* Comment code in English

## Commit messages

* Write commit messages in present tense - for the repo the thing did not happen before you write your message but only when the commit happens.
* Use descriptive messages, not "update to code", or "bugfix".
* Add references to task numbers or issue trackers with more information.

## Code style

* Divide and conquer - if you have to scroll to see a complete method/self-contained piece of code, then split it up.
* Use a common code formatter in your group.
* Follow naming conventions.
* Use logging frameworks.
